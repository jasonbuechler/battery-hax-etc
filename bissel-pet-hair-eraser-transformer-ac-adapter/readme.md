# shame on bissel for using *unnecessarily* proprietary charging hardware

bissel hides the actual shape of the DC plug, as well as the specs of the transformer/ac-adapter, from its website and anywhere else

that's inexcusable these days. 
lithium charging tech is standard across all industries.
this is an old-school Apple-style abuse of public trust
