# rii i8/i8+/i8a/i8b (rf/bluetooth)

## differentiation

i dunno. if i figure it out, this is where it'll be.

## replicating amazon firestick/firetv/fire-tv buttons/keys

### menu/hamburger/three lines/three dots button/key

Use **control-Esc** combo to replicate menu button.

Some sources online also say alt-Esc or simply the 'm' key. These *did not* work for my bluetooth Rii i8+ for my 2nd-gen Fire TV "square".



## frozen? weird? need factory reset?

* use slider switch to power off
* press and hold down the `F1` button/key
* use slider switch to power on
  * note something about blue led
* release the **`F1`** key
  * note another thing about blue led
